#CLEFIA
CLEFIA is a proprietary block cipher algorithm, developed by Sony. Its name is derived from the French word clef, meaning "key".

The **block size is 128 bits** (16 bytes) and the key size can be 128 bit, 192 bit or 256 bit. It is intended to be used in DRM systems. It is among the cryptographic techniques recommended candidate for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC revision in 2013.

##Implementation
This is a practical work for UTN-FRBA assignature Cryptography, there are several points that can be optimized to get a better performance but the main focus was make readable code, easy to understand and similar to the official refference text.
